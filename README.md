# Curriculum Vitae

## Data Scientist | AI Engineer | Cloud Computing | Speech Processing Research

I am a data science professional with a strong background in deep learning and machine learning. I have successfully built a Speech Emotion Recognition system using advanced deep learning techniques, demonstrating my expertise in developing intelligent and responsive systems. 

At the game company, I contributed as a Data Scientist by performing advanced analysis for the security team, ensuring robust protection and risk management. 

My experience in a cloud company involved orchestrating large-scale data migrations, developing a chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, and building innovative machine learning models. These diverse experiences have equipped me with the skills to tackle complex challenges and deliver data-driven solutions across various industries.

## **üìúResearch Paper**

Personalized Speech Emotion Recognition using Few-Shot Learning with Speaker Feature [Link](https://hufs.dcollection.net/public_resource/pdf/200000849567_20250510032619.pdf)

*Proposed a novel Personalized Speech Emotion Recognition (P-SER) model that combines Few-Shot Learning, Wav2Vec2, and ECAPA-TDNN to enhance performance and data efficiency. By integrating speaker and emotion embeddings, the model achieves significant improvements in emotion recognition accuracy with minimal speaker data, demonstrating its effectiveness across various datasets and potential for real-world applications.*
